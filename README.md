This project demonstrates multiple image and video steganography techniques to securely hide sensitive information. Implemented in Python for military-grade applications, it includes:  ✅ LSB &amp; AES + LSB (Hybrid encryption)  ✅ DCT &amp; DWT (Frequency-based hiding)  ✅ PVD &amp; Edge-based LSB (adaptive techniques)
